# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to programming problems given on the website.

For each day, if I have a solution in rust, it can probably be run with:
```
cargo run <input.txt
```

For each day, if I have a solution in haskell, it can probably be run with:
```
runghc src/main.hs <input.txt
